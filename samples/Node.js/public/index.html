        <h1>simple-uploader.js</h1>
        <p>It's a JavaScript library providing multiple simultaneous, stable and resumable uploads via the HTML5 File API.</p>

        <p>The library is designed to introduce fault-tolerance into the upload of large files through HTTP. This is done by splitting each files into small chunks; whenever the upload of a chunk fails, uploading is retried until the procedure completes. This allows uploads to automatically resume uploading after a network connection is lost either locally or to the server. Additionally, it allows for users to pause and resume uploads without loosing state.</p>

        <p>simple-uploader.js relies on the HTML5 File API and the ability to chunks files into smaller pieces. Currently, this means that support is limited to Firefox 4+ and Chrome 11+.</p>
